Day - 1 - Task:

1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

HTTP/1.1:
   * This HTTP method is currently in common use.
   * HTTP/1.1 works on the textual format. so less efficiently parsed and more errors.
   * There is head of line breaking that blocks all the requests behind it until it does't get its all the resources.
   * HTTP/1.1 uses request resource inlining for getting multiple pages. 
   * HTTP/1.1 compress the data itself. and its compression speed less compare to HTTP/2.
   * safety is less compared to HTTP/2
   
HTTP/2:
   * HTTP/2 works on the binory protocal. binary protocols consumed less band width so more efficiently and less error.
   * HTTP/2 is multiplexed so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests. 
   * HTTP/2 uses PUSH frame by server that collect all the multiple pages.
   * HTTP/2 uses HPACK for compressing the data. so its compression speed is high. 
   * increasing user and application security.

   2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?
   
      Objects are different then primitive datatypes(number, string, boolean). primitive datatypes contain one value but object can hold many values in form of
      keys: value pair. these keys can be variable or functions and are called properties or methods.
      
      Every objects have some property with some value. these value can accessed by these properties.
      
      In javascript name:value pairs called properties. (key - property; value - property value)
      
      var myBike = {Make:"Bajaj",colour:"Black",Model:2013}
      
      Accessing object properties in two ways:
      
      objectName.propertyName (or) objectName["propertyName"]
      ex: myBike.Make (or) myBike["Make"]
      
      Object methods:
      const person = {
      firstName = "mohamed"
      lastName = "rafik"
      age = "28"
      fullName : function() {
      return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
      }
      }
      
      this.firstName means the firstName property of person
      
      Accessing object methods:
      objectName.methodName()
      Ex: Name = person.fullName
